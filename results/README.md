# Results README

`results/` stores generated artifacts from reproducible experiment runs.

## Purpose

This directory is the run-output layer for:
- machine-readable metrics
- tabular model comparisons
- diagnostic figures used in reports

## Directory Layout

- `results/metrics/`: JSON/CSV metrics and run configuration payloads
- `results/tables/`: model comparison tables for downstream reporting
- `results/figures/`: diagnostic plots for prediction behavior analysis

## How To Run

### Generate baseline artifacts

```bash
python scripts/train_baselines.py --subset FD001 --rul_cap 125 --window 30 --step 1 --val_fraction 0.2 --seed 42
```

Expected terminal output:
- shape diagnostics for windows/tabular features
- saved path lines for metrics/table/figures
- ranked comparison table printed to stdout

Artifacts written:
- `results/metrics/baselines_FD001.json`
- `results/tables/baseline_comparison_FD001.csv`
- `results/figures/pred_vs_true_<model>_FD001.png`
- `results/figures/error_vs_rul_<model>_FD001.png`

### Verify artifact presence

```bash
ls -1 results/metrics results/tables results/figures
```

Expected terminal output:
- directory listings that include files generated by the training run.

Artifacts:
- none additionally written by this check command.

## Decision-Use Framing

Use result artifacts for maintenance policy calibration:
- `metrics/` quantifies expected timing error and near-failure behavior.
- `tables/` supports model selection under operational constraints.
- `figures/` exposes systematic over/under-prediction that affects replacement timing and false alarm rates.

Recommended interpretation order:
1. Validate overall and stratified RUL metrics.
2. Inspect error behavior near low-RUL regions.
3. Translate error profiles into inspection cadence and replacement thresholds.

## Commit Boundaries

Not committed by default:
- generated files in `results/metrics/`, `results/tables/`, `results/figures/`

Committed:
- `results/README.md`
- optional placeholder files used to preserve directory structure
