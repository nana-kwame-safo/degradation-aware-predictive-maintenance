    "Construct Health Index (HI) signals and evaluate HI quality for maintenance decision support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "- HI trajectories by unit\n",
    "- HI quality metrics (monotonicity, smoothness, correlation)\n",
    "- Threshold-oriented decision analysis artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "- HI is derived from available sensors without future leakage\n",
    "- Evaluation is aligned with reliability-focused interpretation\n",
    "- All reusable logic is promoted to src/ modules\n"
